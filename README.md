# Snake-Game
A classic Snake Game implementation using Python's turtle module. You can control the snake with arrow keys, eat randomly appearing food, grow in size, and try not to hit the walls or yourself!

This project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with modular design — separating logic into snake.py, food.py, and scoreboard.py.

🚀 Features

Randomly placed food using the Food class

Growing snake as it eats

Score tracking with Scoreboard class

Game over when hitting walls or self

Modular OOP-based structure with:

Snake class

Food class

Scoreboard class
